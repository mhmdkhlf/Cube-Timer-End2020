# Rubiks-Cube-Timer-Program

This project is a Rubik's Cube Timer. I built it using Python and, I mainly used pygame for the user-interface (weird choice but, I like pygame), and I used Tkinter for a pop-up window, and I used matplotlib for some data visualization. 

This program includes: 
-timer (controlled with the spacebar)
-scramble generator for puzzles ranging from 2x2 to 5x5 and Megaminx
-addition of penalties to solve times
-input of solves times, and modification of solves times
-averages, means, fastest, and slowest times
-data visualization/plotting of the solve times at the end of every session
